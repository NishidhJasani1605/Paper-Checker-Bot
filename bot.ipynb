    "    -   Do not stop early under any circumstances.\n",

    "    -   For each question number, extract the full **English version** of the question text.\n",
    "    -   If a question has multiple-choice options (e.g., A, B, C, D), you **MUST** include those options as part of the `question_text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  ***\"OR\" (अथवा) QUESTION HANDLING***:\n",
    "    -   Many questions have an 'OR' (अथवा) option. For these, your `question_text` **MUST** include the text for **BOTH** the main question and the 'OR' question.\n",
